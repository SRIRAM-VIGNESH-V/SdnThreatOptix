# SdnThreatOptix
The SdnThreatOptix project concentrates on creating a machine learning model for classifying Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within SDN networks, servers, and databases. It employs network infrastructure management tools such as Telegraf and Mininet for SDN network emulation, alongside InfluxDB for data storage and visualization.
