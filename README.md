# SdnThreatOptix
The SdnThreatOptix project concentrates on creating a machine learning model for classifying Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within SDN networks, servers, and databases. It employs network infrastructure management tools such as Telegraf and Mininet for SDN network emulation, alongside InfluxDB for data storage and visualization.

## Setup:
This project is a derivative of my previous project, SdnInfraOptix, which focused on monitoring SDN network infrastructure. For VM installation, RYu controller setup, Mininet configuration,Telegraph interfacing and SDN initialization, please refer to my GitHub repository at https://github.com/SRIRAM-VIGNESH-V/SDNInfraOptix.
